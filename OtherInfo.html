                <h1>Insurance Protection &amp; Safety</h1>
                <h5>Workmen’s Compensation &amp;
                General Liability Coverage</h5>
                <p>Tree service work is among the most hazardous of all
                  professions. According to SCA Today (the official
                  newsletter of the Society of Commercial Arborculture) the
                  odds of a tree service worker being seriously injured or
                  killed in any given year are about 1 in120. That equates to
                  a fatality and injury rate for tree service workers that is
                  three times higher than that of a police officer or fire fighter.</p>
                <p>Despite these facts, many tree service companies have
                  discontinued their coverage, leaving both their workers and
                  their customers at risk. A recent survey of tree service
                  companies operating in the Long Island area revealed that
                  less than 50 % carried both workmen’s compensation and
                  general liability insurance coverage.</p>
                <p>How does this affect you? With the average tree service
                  worker injury claim approaching $25,000 and severe injury
                  costs at substantially higher rates….you may be the one at
                  risk. For if a tree service worker is severely injured on
                  your job and they don’t have workmen’s compensation
                  coverage, the injured worker will likely seek compensation
                  from you.</p>
                <p>Don’t devastate your financial future. There is only
                  one way to be sure that the tree service company you
                  choose has worker’s compensation and general
                  liability insurance coverage. Insist that they
                  provide a Certificate of Insurance.</p>
                <p>St. Croix Tree Service protects
                  our customers with Workmen’s
                  Compensation and General
                  Liability coverage of $5,000,000
                  and we document this
                  coverage with a Certificate
                  of Insurance.</p>
                <h5>Our Safety Record</h5>
                <p>Our safety record is unparalleled.
                  We train our tree service workers
                  to follow all safety procedures so
                  that there will be no accidents, no
                  injuries and no damage to your
                  property.</p>
                <h5>Property Protection
                  Guarantee</h5>
                <p>The St. Croix Tree Service
                  Property Protection Guarantee
                  means that if our equipment or our
                  workers damage your property,
                  you will be completely covered by
                  our insurance and you will not
                  incur any out of pocket expense.</p>

                <a name="bill"><h1>Customer Bill Of Rights</h1></a>
                <p>Even though tree service companies should be licensed in our area, there are still &quot;fly-by-night&quot; tree
                  service companies that often violate the rights of their customers. We set the standards for the tree
                  service industry by creating the Customer Bill of Rights. This document details what customers should
                expect from a tree service company.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>As a St. Croix Tree Service customer, we
                    firmly believe you have the following rights:</li>
                  <li>You have a right to expect that your tree service
                    company will show up when they say they will

                  <li>You have a right to expect that your tree
                    service company will adhere to National
                    Arborist Association pruning standards and
                    not engage in unprofessional tree care tactics.</li>
                  <li>You have a right to expect that only
                    knowledgeable, experienced tree service
                    workers will be allowed to work on your
                    property.</li>
                  <li>You have a right to expect all tree service
                    workers will adhere to a strict code of conduct

                    workers will follow on the job safety standards
                    and wear brightly colored uniforms, so that
                    they are visible to their co-workers,
                    pedestrians and passing motorists.</li>
                  <li>You have a right to expect that the tree service
                    workers on your job will posses the required
                    communication skills to address your
                    questions and concerns.</li>
                  <li>You have a right to expect your tree service

                    work is done.</li>
                  <li>You have a right to expect that your tree
                    service company will operate in an
                    environmentally friendly manner by recycling
                    nearly 100% of all the trees and brush they
                    remove from your property.</li>

<a name="art"><h1>State Of The Art Equipment</h1></a>
                <p>St. Croix Tree Service uses only state of the art equipment, specifically designed for high-production tree
                  service work. That means we can work more efficiently and get your job completed faster than almost
                  all of our competitors. With a fleet of equipment that includes bucket trucks, cranes, log loaders,
                tractors, stump grinders and wood chippers… we can safely handle any job, big or small.</p>
                <p><strong>Bucket Trucks</strong>—The bucket truck is used to lift
                  tree service workers high in the air, so they can
                  safely work on trees that can’t be reached from the
                  ground. It is an absolutely essential vehicle for any
                  tree service company, due to the extreme heights
                  and difficult locations in which we are required to
                  work. To insure that our bucket trucks are kept in
                  good working order, we submit to a rigorous,
                  annual safety inspection by the truck’s
                  manufacturer.</p>
                <p><strong>Cranes</strong>—Used for difficult tree removal, we have
                  access to high capacity cranes that can lift large
                  sections of trees over or around buildings, when we
                  do not have the option of letting the cut tree
                  sections fall to the ground. Cranes save
                  considerable time on the job and they are much
                  safer for tree service workers to use than
                  conventional tree removal methods. Crane use
                  also protects our client’s valuable property from
                  damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Log Loaders</strong>—Also referred to as “knuckle cranes”
                  log loaders are specifically designed to load logs.
                  These machines, which can lift up to 3 ½ tons, are
                  known as “back-savers” because they can quickly
                  and safely lift loads that would otherwise require
                  hours of manual labor.</p>
                <p><strong>Tractors</strong>—We use two distinctly different types of
                  tractors, both with specialized attachments for tree
                  service work. One is a compact tractor with “turf-
                  friendly” tires. It is used to pick up brush and logs in
                  areas where access it tight. Our second type of
                  tractor is a large, heavy-duty tractor, used primarily
                  for lot and land clearing.</p>
                <p><strong>Stump Grinders</strong>—After a dead or unwanted tree
                  has been removed, stump grinders can either grind
                  down or totally remove the stump. Many of our
                  competitors use outdated “tow behind” stump
                  grinders, which are large, slow, machines that need
                  to be hooked to the back of a truck in order to work.
                  We use only self-propelled stump grinders, that are
                  small enough to fit through tight spaces, yet
                  powerful enough to quickly grind any stump.</p>
                <p><strong>Wood Chippers</strong>—Most wood chippers can only
                  grind up brush. Our wood chippers are different.
                  They are not just brush chippers but heavy duty
                  chippers designed to quickly grind brush and logs
                  up to 18 inches in diameter into quality mulch.</p>
