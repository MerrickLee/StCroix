                <h1>Emerald Ash Borer (EAB)</h1>
                <p> <img src="Images/eab1.jpg" alt="Emerald Ash Borer" width="279" height="192" class="FloatLeft" />EAB is an exotic pest from Asia that was first discovered in
                  Michigan in 2002. Since its discovery, EAB has been responsible for killing millions
                  of ash trees in the United States. This invasive insect has spread like wildfire and
                  is now present in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota,
                  Missouri, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, Wisconsin, West
                  Virginia, and Canada.
                  Emerald ash borer, in North America, has only been noted to attack true ash species
                  (Fraxinus sp.), not mountain ash (Sorbus sp). One thing unusual about this wood-
                  boring beetle is that it attacks and kills completely healthy trees as well as stressed
                  trees.</p>
                <h4>Signs/symptoms:</h4>
                <p>Signs and symptoms that may mean your ash tree is under attack by EAB include,
                  Tip dieback, crown thinning, abundant epicormic sprouts (sucker growth),
                  woodpecker damage, small D-shaped exit holes in the bark, and serpentine galleries
                  underneath the bark. Detection is difficult from the ground and often requires
                  ascending into the upper part of the canopy for a closer evaluation. Only a certified
                  arborist should conduct this evaluation.</p>
                <h4><br />
                  Life cycle:</h4>
                <p>Emerald ash borer belongs to a group of beetles called the metallic woodborers
                  because of the adult beetles’ iridescent color. They spend the winter as larvae in
                  small cells just beneath the bark. Full-grown larvae are ½-1 inch long, white, and
                  slender with two brownish projections on the last segment of the body.</p>
                
                <p>Larvae
                pupate in spring and adults emerge during May, June, and July. The adults chew
                  their way through the bark, leaving characteristic D-shaped exit holes, which are
                  useful in identifying emerald ash borer problems. Adults are slender, metallic green
                  beetles. They are about 1/2 inch long with blunt heads and pointed bodies. Adult
                  females live for about 4 weeks and deposit eggs under loose bark or in cracks or
                  crevices on the trunk. Eggs hatch within 2 weeks, and larvae bore into the tree and
                  feed on the vascular tissue directly underneath the bark. They feed in a serpentine
                  pattern and leave behind S-shaped galleries. This feeding damage is what is
                  responsible for killing the tree.</p>
                <h4><br />
                  Control:</h4>
                <p>Cultural- there are a few simple things that should be done in order to naturally
                  slow the spread of EAB and decrease the negative impact this beetle will have
                  on our area. The first thing to do is to stop planting ash trees and start planting
                  a variety of other tree species. When planting trees be sure to select a variety of
                  species that are well suited for the specific environment they are being planted in.
                  The next thing to do is to stop moving firewood. There are many different pests that
                  are transported and spread when people move firewood.</p>
                <p><strong>Chemical</strong> - There are many different insecticides out there to protect ash trees
                from EAB. Some of the treatments are much more effective than others and the
                effectiveness depends upon many different factors. In general, it is typically best
                  to use the trunk injected insecticide called Emamectin Benzoate on trees 15” in
                  diameter at breast height (DBH) and larger. Usually with trees smaller then 15” in
                  diameter at breast height you can get good protection with a soil applied systemic
                  insecticide called imidicloprid. However, soil applied applications need to be
                  repeated at least every year and Emamectin Benzoate has had great control for 3
                  years. Each situation should be evaluated by a certified arborist to come up with the
                best management strategy for your trees.</p>
